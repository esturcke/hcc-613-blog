## Jacket from *Back to the Future Part II*

The jacket in the film *Back to the Future Part II* is casual attire intended for daily activity in the then future, 2015, and worn by protagonist Marty McFly as well as his son. Stylistically it looks somewhat like a letterman with sleeves in a secondary color. As with the shoes that self-lace, the jacket is also automated, adjusting the sleeve length. A feature that is highlighted in the film is that the jacket is also self-drying. My guess is that this could be useful if caught it the rain, or in McFly's case after foolishly trying to use a hoverboard over water and falling in. The jacket not only dries itself, [but also the person wearing it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZ73TLa_aL4).

## Supersuits from *The Incredibles*

In *The Incredibles* each super has a custom supersuit used in the context of hero work and as such is tailored to the super's needs. It acts both as a symbol projecting the super's image as well as to protect their secret identity. The Incredibles specifically have supersuits with embedded technology. They look like standard superhero stretchy suits, but they have a tracking module located in the dot of the "i" on the chest allowing each member of the family to be located from a central device. Sadly, the context of hero work was not considered when designing the suits and triggering the tracking module led to the discovery and capture of Mr. Incredible.

## James Bond's Watches

The context of James Bond's watches is use while doing spy work. To a large extent they are simply meant to look classy and there are [sites](http://jamesbondwatches.com/the-list-eon-movies.htm) [dedicated](http://jamesbondwatches.com/) to identifying brand and model of each watch used in the various films (often something expensive like a Rolex, TAG Heuer or Omega). [Per Watchtime](http://www.watchtime.com/featured/watches-james-bond/), starting with *Thunderball* technology beyond telling time was being added, including buzz saws, lasers, a magnet to divert bullets, a remote detonator and even a ticker tape to receive messages.
