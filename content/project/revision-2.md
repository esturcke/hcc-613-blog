# Evaluation Summary

Again, the revision was shown to 5 people. This time demographics were somewhat
older with two people in their 60s. Still, all knew James Bond. The story is
still capturing more attention than the prototype and even with the work I did
on the plot people are still distracted by holes in the plot. It's interesting
that one person evaluating thought the video looked like an advertisement for
the watch and so perhaps things are moving in the right direction, and perhaps
this is starting to take on a better balance. Based on the responses the
interaction is somewhat clearer although there is still some confusion.

# What I Changed

This week I finished revising the watch interaction by reworking the laser
portion. Again, interactions with the bezel and buttons are animated to help
viewers see more clearly what Bond is doing. I hope that the higher fidelity
will also focus viewers attention on the watch while still maintaining an
entertaining story line. I also replaced the text on the watch with typed text
so that it's more legible.
