## Extraordinaires

The first exercise was to create an [Extraordinare
card](https://www.extraordinaires.com/) to remind ourselves again who we are
creating interfaces for. The card shows a main scene, an alternate scene, a
surprising scene and a detail. My card attempts to bring out that Bond is
confident and talented, but with the surprise that there is a lot of turmoil
under his flawless exterior.

## From Version 1 â†’ Version 2

For the in class evaluations, we had one of our classmates walk through the
storyboard and attempt to tell the story. Sadly, my drawings were exceptionally
poor, but we still managed to stumble though the story. It was clear that I
needed to take more care creating the drawings if I want to present it to
another person. My classmate also provided some valuable suggestions, such as
varying the shots and also even the shape of the boxes. Since we would need to
turn this into a video, I stuck with 16:9 frames, but I did adjust the shots.

The primary change, however, was to just take more care when drawing. I used
the tracing method discussed in class to create the frames. Many are based on
actual James Bond footage. Others are composites of miscellaneous photos found
online or photos I took.

## Using the Prototypes in the Stories

I tried to keep the prototypes as seamless as possible within a narrative.
Gadgets are important to Bond's persona, but not central. They are simply used
when needed, possibly in slightly contrived ways, and then are put away. I
believe I am staying true to this with these stories.

I believe this also fits well with the idea of using stories to present prototypes.
Stories are meant to draw people in and when showcasing a prototype, they need
to provide a realistic framework so that the prototype can be seen in context.

## Reflections on Extraordinaires and Storyboarding

I found the Extraordinaires very interesting. It was a challenge to distill the
essence of James Bond in two pictures and then find the most surprising twist
to his character. _Skyfall_ did provide a nice twist because they go into his
struggle as he ages. The detail was also fun to look for something that plays
on both the typical and surprise. The scorpion on his hand is both his ability
to thrive in the face of danger, but it is also while he is drinking away his
troubles. The detail also provides an element of intrigue.

This nicely mirrors things we talked about in story telling. There is a setup
and a turn of something unexpected. But story telling goes further by following
a series of connected consequences and concluding with some resolution. In contrast,
Extraodinares is open ended. It invites a story to be told, but details
have to be filled in by the observer.

## Where I Would Use It

Even with the parallels between the Extraodinares and story telling, and the fun 
I had coming up with the Extraordinaires, in the end, I didn't really make use if
it for the story. I could see interesting stories coming out of at exercise like
this, but for Bond, the crisis of getting old didn't play into interesting
situations to showcase the prototype.
