# Evaluation Summary

The initial version was shown to 5 people, all in their 30s. They had all at
least heard of James Bond and most of them knew several things about him. The
overall impression was favorable although the first half of the video was seen
as too detailed and there were a number of holes in the plot where the
progression was hard to follow. For example, how did Bond get tied up on the
train (which was also mistaken for a jail cell), and why was the detonation
cancelled. It was interesting how much of the feedback was about the story. My
goal was to embed the prototype as seamlessly as possible so that it doesn't
feel like a showcase or tutorial, but the plot holes in the story seem to be a
distraction and the prototype is a bit too much in the background. The
prototype itself got somewhat mixed responses. Some people caught on to a
surprising amount of detail of how the watch worked. Others either expressed
some confusion over how he interacted with the watch or it was clear based on
their responses that the prototype was vague on aspects of interaction.

# What I Changed

This week I focused on some of the watch interaction issues that came up as
this is the main goal of the class and is clearly an area that needed
improvement based on feedback.

The first step was to create separate watch assets for each of the moving parts
so that they could be animated.

I replaced the Act II watch scenes with more detailed versions of the watch
showing the steps performed more accurately. I also added a new message telling
Bond to abort giving a reason why he didn't detonate the explosives. This both
demonstrates more watch interactions and hopefully makes the plot a bit easier
to follow.
