## Rolestorming

### Round 1

For the first round I created a short narrative linking the three [identified
tasks](../data-gathering/). First we had to break out an armored room using a
laser cutter. Then we received a message instructing us the coordinates to
place a mine which we then remotely detonated. We performed each task as
closely to how Bond would have.

#### Laser Cutter

##### What task did the user perform?

He had to cut his way out of a closet.

##### How did they complete this task?

He took off the watch, held the watch with both hands, pressed the bottom of the watch bezel, and cut around the outside of the door. Then they kicked the door in.
  
##### What information did the device give your user?

The device indicated on the screen that the watch was ready to arm the laser and then gave a warning flash when the laser was about the be activated. It also had an indicator while the laser was running and a battery charge indicated and overheating indicator.

##### How did the device give feedback?

Most of the feedback was visual on the screen and indicator lights on the top of the bezel. There was also an audio beep for the warning when arming the laser.

#### Message Receiving

##### What task did the user perform?

He received an important message with instructions.

##### How did they complete this task?

He felt a vibration from his watch. He looked at the watch and saw a message on the screen. He pressed a message to confirm reading the message and dismissing it. The message no longer showed the message and MI6 was notified that he read the message.
 
##### What information did the device give your user?

The device indicated on the screen that there was a message, along with the contents of the message. The UI also gave cues as to how to conform/dismiss the message, archive it for later reference, or reply to the message.

##### How did the device give feedback?

When the message came in, the watch vibrated. All other feedback was visual.

#### Mine Detonation

##### What task did the user perform?

The user had to detonated a mine.

##### How did they complete this task?

He placed a mine and synced it with his watch by touching the mine with the watch. He then left the area and selected the mine he wanted to detonate by rotating the bezel. He then pressed and held the bottom of the bezel for 1 second.
 
##### What information did the device give your user?

The watch showed the mine that was synced with the watch as well as the arm state. It visually indicated that the mine was about the be detonated by a flashing light at the top of the watch.

##### How did the device give feedback?

The feedback was all visual.

#### Common to All Tasks

##### What parts of their body were used to interact with device?

Both hands were used to interact with the device.

##### Where was the UI / screen placed on the device?

The UI was on the watch face and along the watch bezel.

##### What size is the screen?

A circle with 3.5cm diameter.

### Round 2

We followed the same narrative for this round, but inspired by the exercise in
class, we tried to do things how we personally would do them and unlike Bond.
To help with this I used my cell phone as my "watch". The pull will be to look
to current smart watches as inspiration, and this will help get an idea of
problems smart watch interaction would have for James Bond like tasks.

#### Laser Cutter

##### What task did the user perform?

Again, he had to cut his way out of a closet.

##### How did they complete this task?

He took his "watch" out of his pocket, then swiped up to see a set of frequent tasks. He tapped on the laser app. He waited for the app to load, then pointed the top of the "watch" to the door and tapped on the button to turn the laser on. He then cut out the door and kicked it in.
  
##### What information did the device give your user?

The device showed the user that the laser was on.

##### How did the device give feedback?

All the feedback was visual and on the main screen.

#### Message Receiving

##### What task did the user perform?

He received another important message with instructions.

##### How did they complete this task?

In this round there was also a vibration. He glanced at his "watch" and read the message. He then pressed the top button to turn off the screen to conserve battery life.
 
##### What information did the device give your user?

The device let him know there was a message as well as the content of the message.

##### How did the device give feedback?

When the message came in, the watch vibrated. All other feedback was visual.

#### Mine Detonation

##### What task did the user perform?

The user had to detonated a mine, yet again.

##### How did they complete this task?

He placed a mine and swiped up to get to the frequent apps. The mine app was not there and so he swiped again to unlock his "watch". He had to authenticate by tapping a 4 digit code on the screen. He then swiped through pages of apps until he found the mine app. He tapped the icon and waited for the app to load. He then tapped the discover button and saw a list mines with one item. He tapped on the mine and a second later, the mine was paired with then "watch". He then took cover and went to detonate the mine, but his "watch" had locked and he went through the unlock process again. He found and opened the mine app again and selected the paired mine. He then tapped on the detonate button.
 
##### What information did the device give your user?

The device showed which mine was paired and the current status of the mine.

##### How did the device give feedback?

Again, the feedback was all visual.

#### Common to All Tasks

##### What parts of their body were used to interact with device?

Both hands were used to interact with the device.

##### Where was the UI / screen placed on the device?

The UI was on the watch face only.

##### What size is the screen?

A 4" rectangle.

## Group Brainstorming

The following are ideas from a group brainstorming session:

### Laser Cutter

  * Press the screen to activate the laser (like turning on the on a cell phone flash light)
  * Press a button on the bottom of the watch bezel, warning indicator on watch face that laser is active.
  * Voice activate the laser.
  * Rotate the bezel to select laser mode, screen on face indicates what is selected.
  * Align two things, once they align, laser turns on.

### Message Receiving

  * Message is displayed on the watch face behind the watch hands.
  * Message is displayed on the glass in from on the watch hands.
  * Watch face flips up, revealing a screen under it.
  * A screen pops up from under the watch face.
  * Message projected from watch onto a surface.
  * Laser etches message into a surface.

### Mine Detonation

  * Press a button to sync to a mine.
  * Tap a code to detonate.
  * Tap on the watch face.
  * Indicator on screen that mine will detonate and arm/disarm state.

## Mind Map

The third brainstorming technique I used was a mind map.

## Potential Solutions

### 1. Display on face, interacting with physical watch components

This is the most conservative, and close to what I ended up picking. Feedback see primarily from the watch face and interaction is through buttons and dials already on the watch. The screen side would be around 35mm.

### 2. Digital touch screen display

This is basically given Bond and Apple Watch. It is flexible, but fiddly. The face is the display as well as the ineraction surface. The size of the screen could be slightly bigger, up to 45mm.

### 3. Projection display and gestures

This is the science fiction solution. Nano projects could project a large display on any surface or even directly on the retina. Interaction might be removed form the watch an be based on image recognition or gestures.

### 4. Hidden or pop up display

With a hidden display, the watch would maintain it's classic appeal, but still be flexible for interaction tasks. Feedback would either be through subtle vibrations when closed, or visually when the display is out. The screen could be up to 45mm.

## Final Decision

##### Where is it located on your user?

I would like a hybrid solution with three screens, one low powered e-ink display on the watch face and two full color display hidden under the watch face that can be accessed by flipping the face up. In addition, I would like a single subtle LED on the bezel.

##### How does your user interact with it?

Interaction will primarily be via the bezel, crown and existing watch buttons. The hidden full color displays may be touch sensitive.

##### What size is it?

Each of the displays is ~3.5cm circles.

##### How does this provide feedback?

There will be audio feedback and vibration for notifications and warnings. The rest of the feedback will be visual and indicate current mode, status information and actions that can be performed in the current mode.

## Reflection

### Rolestorming

Rolestorming is a hybrid between role playing and brainstorming. The idea is physically act out how a specific user would interact with the device in different scenarios, but then to also drastically alter some of the constraints usually in place when role playing. In my case, 3 tasks were acted out as James Bond in character with a watch I could imagine him wearing. I then acted out the three tasks again, but with a cell phone rather than a watch, and breaking our of the James Bond role, fumbling in my interactions. As with roleplaying, this has advantages of putting yourself in the place of the user, trying to think like them, while also making the interactions very concrete. This helps spot parts of the interactions that might otherwise be overlooked. Breaking some of the constraints help break through to other potential useful solutions or to solidify what specific needs the original user has. A disadvantage is that fewer ideas are generated as it take time to act things out.

### Group Brainstorming

Group brainstorming is the classic form of brainstorming where people sit together and come up with ideas. The quantity of ideas is emphasised and so no vetting is done during brain storming. You just try to get it all out. With the group dynamic, there is the added benefit that you can spring board off of one another's ideas. The benefit is a rich pool to pick from. I found, however that it was easy to get stuck. However, it served as a good starting point for the final brainstorming activity. 

### Mind Map

Mind maps is a brain storming technique that places generated ideas in a tree structure. The central idea is placed at the center and then from there you branch out with ideas derived from others. This fits well into go off on to tangents with one idea without getting lost and being able to return. I found this structure helpful to branch out evenly to different areas of the problem and still maintain a good overview of ideas I was coming up with. It helps to have some idea of the problem and the drawback is perhaps that it is not as easy to come up with something totally different that might work. But it helps to put structure to existing ideas and expending to related ideas.

### Overall Experience

The mind map was significantly easier for me. I appreciate the structure and being able to maintain an overview. But perhaps equally it was easier because I had already gone through two other rounds of brainstorming and I already have many ideas that just needed to be organized. Acting out was the least comfortable for me, but helps see details I would otherwise miss. I would like to collapse the brainstorming with the mind map. Springboard off of other's ideas is helpful, but I think I generate more ideas with the structure of mind maps.

### Evaluation Method

Based on the data gathering, the screen must be visible both in low light and bright light such as a snowy mountain. An optionally lit e-ink display is well suited for this. The added benefit with this is low power draw. The primary interaction should be with physical buttons or dials as James Bond will usually be using these functions in high stress and time critical situations. Fiddling with a touch screen may be too frustrating. Physical buttons together with multi-modal feedback including vibrations and sounds, will help with eye free operation. The color displays inside the watch will give flexibility later if we need richer visual feedback, but they will not be primary. Above all, James Bond as the perfect gentleman cares about style. His watch needs to look classes and not like a gadget.
