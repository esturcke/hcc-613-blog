## Design Context

I'm beginning to treat Bond as an extremely competent novice user. Based on the
primary source material, he is always able to figure out how to use his gadgets
the first time he needs them. He often only gets a very short introduction to
how they work. Bond would likely want something that is intuitive, but also
very efficient to use in high stress situations. I have tried to introduce some
color coding in response to the evaluation to make clearer what's going on.

Since I had added the ability to save messages, I added a new task
analysis for reading saved messages:

```
0. in order to read a saved message
    1. select message mode
        1.1 press the right button
        1.2 turn the dial to message mode
        1.3 press right button
    2. select message to read
        2.1 turn dial to message
        2.2 press right button to select
    3. read message
        3.1 read text message on watch face
        3.2 turn dial to scroll

Plan 0: Do 1 — 2 — 3 in order.  
Plan 1: Optionally do 1.1 then do 1.2 — 1.3 in order.  
Plan 2: Do 2.1 — 2.2 in order.  
Plan 3: Do 3.1 and then 3.2 if needed for longer messages.  
```

I have included this in the "receiving a message" prototype, but I'm wondering 
if Bond should even have the ability to save messages. He should be able to
remember messages he has seen and having the messages on his watch might be
more of a liability than a help. I have kept it for now, but this might
be removed again in later revisions.

Some feedback that I got again this week is that the user tried to use the
watch as a touch screen. I am trying to keep the physical button interaction
for style and usability reasons I talked about last week—and because I don't
want this to become an Apple Watch—but I might have to reconsider this as
well. For now I am keeping the physical buttons and dials. In the end with
Bond, I think style trumps.

## From Version 1 → Version 2

  - [Read Message — Version 1](/hcc-613/keynote-read-message-v1.pdf)
  - [Read Message — Version 2](/hcc-613/keynote-read-message-v2.pdf)
  - [Explosives — Version 1](/hcc-613/keynote-explosives-v1.pdf)
  - [Explosives — Version 2](/hcc-613/keynote-explosives-v2.pdf)

Moving from version 1 to version 2 I tried to improve the clarity of:

  - what can be done?
  - how it can be done?
  - what was just done?

These are the weakest parts of my design based on the in-class evaluation.
Originally, I was planning on using a black and white e-ink display on the
face of the watch. Now I am considering moving to a color e-ink display.
I'm hoping to use the color to draw attention to what actions can be taken.

## Reflections of Medium Fidelity Prototyping with Keynote

I found that creating the assets was the main time sink while using Keynote for
prototyping. It took a while to create the watch and hands, and I had to resort to
using Illustrator. Working in Keynote, however, was quick. Object snapping worked
well and copying assets between slides was frictionless. I ran into a few problems.
I wasn't able to figure out how to use animations to move the clock hands and I was
a bit clumsy using the built-in drawing tools. 

## Where I Would Use It

A few years ago I read a number of blog posts where people were very excited
about using Keynote as a prototyping tool. It looked interesting, but I never
gave it a go. I am pleased to find how easy it was to model the interaction.
I've used Balsamiq a number of times at work, and I found Keynote much quicker
to work with. Snapping and resizing objects works very, as does duplicating
and linking slides. My favorite tool for medium fidelity prototyping had
been HTML/Javascript, but I think I might try using Keynote the next time
I need to create a prototype to present to others at work.
