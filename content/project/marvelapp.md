## Design Context

Overall the design is very similar to the previous one. I'm keeping in mind
that this watch will not see heavy use, but when it is used by Bond, he will
usually be under significant pressure. I continued to refine the appearance
of the controls to make them easier to see on the small display and refined
the color coding to improve consistency. I'm continuing to disregard feedback
that this should be a touch display. I believe it stems from our familiarity
with mobile touch devices and that all our prototypes thus far have been
on laptop or cell phone screens, while I'm trying to keep Bond in mind.

## From [Version 1](https://marvelapp.com/bbb167) â†’ [Version 2](https://marvelapp.com/1687iji)

The initial Marvel prototype was a bit of a disaster. It ended up not being
centered on the screen and after scrolling to center, advancing to the next
screen would scroll back. This led to a very choppy experience and made the
evaluation difficult. Also, watch on my iPhone screen ended up being very
small.

For version 2, I turned the prototype on its side. A classmate also recommended
checking the Marvel website for the correct image dimensions to use.

The main feedback was that everything was too small. In part, this was due to a
smaller than scale prototype. But I still think it was useful and valid feedback.
If Bond is indeed going to be using this in high stress situations, we want the
icons and text to be very quick to read. I worked on cleaning up the icons and
enlarging the interface elements and text. To make room for the larger
elements, I created new animations to move the watch hands out of the way.

## Reflections of Mobile Prototyping with Marvel

Marvel is very similar feature wise to Invision. Again, I didn't use any of the
advanced sharing and commenting features and so Marvel paled compared to
Keynote. And again, I did all the creative work in Keynote, After Effects and
Photoshop. The mobile prototyping aspect, however, was eye opening. Even though
it was on a phone, it was much easier to see problems with font and icon sizes.
It was also easier to get a feel for the interactions. Marvel also lets you
incorporate swipe interaction. It was a bit finicky and sadly you can't overlay
a swipe up and down on the same area, but it was still interesting trying to
model the rotating phone bevel using swipe.  

## Where I Would Use It

Prototypes on a mobile device really feels different than on a screen. Accuracy
in scale is important to uncover design problems. I would use something like
this when working with screen on mobile devices. Just being able to hold it in
my hand, see something to scale and cleanly see transitions was delightful.
