## Overview

What follows is a brief analysis of our fictional user James Bond, along with
task and environmental analyses of using a few of his many watches. Unless
otherwise noted, the observations come from *The Spy Who Loved Me*, *Goldeneye*
and *Skyfall*. 

Although James Bond seems to wear watching mainly for style, fitting his role
as the gentleman, there are a number of times that he makes use of Q
provisioned gadgets. Some of these can be found on Gear Patrol's
[The Watches of James Bond](http://gearpatrol.com/2012/11/05/timekeeping-the-watches-of-james-bond/). More details on the specific models—although with less emphasis on the gadgets—are listed on Dell Deaton's [JamesBondWatches.com](http://jamesbondwatches.com/).

Some things I would like to know:

  1. Was M like a mother figure to him?
  2. Does he want to get married and have a family?
  3. How many women has he actually fallen in love with? 

## Task & Environment Analysis

### Ticker Tape Messaging 

{{% fig "message-watch.jpg" %}}**Figure 2** Bond makin' labels in bed in *The Spy Who Loved Me*.{{% /fig %}}

In *The Spy Who Loved Me*, Bond receives a pre-SMS embossed text message spit out by his watch. So the watch has a way to receive transmissions, possibly radio.

#### Task

MI6 needs to notify Bond:

  1. There is an audible ticking as the message is output, alerting Bond of the incoming message.
  2. He glances over at the message coming out of the watch. 
  3. It's unclear what he does with the message after reading it. Perhaps he tears the message off an discards it.

#### Environment

  * Indoor, in a log cabin in the mountains, while in bed.
  * Low light, lit by a fireplace.
  * Quiet enough to hear the subtle ticking of the message is still audible.

### Laser Cutter

{{% fig "laser-watch.jpg" %}}**Figure 3** Bond laser cutting his way out of the train in *Goldeneye*.{{% /fig %}}

The Omega watch in *Goldeneye* has a laser that is emitted from the top of the watch face that can be used to cut through metal. 

#### Task

Bond is trapped in an armored tain car and needs to escape:

  1. Bond takes off his watch.
  2. It's not clear, but perhaps he presses something towards the bottom of the watch face to turn on the laser.
  3. He points the laser to cut through the floor of an armored train.

#### Environment

  * Inside of a train car.
  * Poor light.
  * Hot.

### Mine Arming and Disarming

{{% fig "disarmed-mine.jpg" %}}**Figure 5** A disarmed mine.{{% /fig %}}

Also from *Goldeneye* is the Omega Seamaster's ability to remotely arm and disarm mines. In the film, we don't see Bond using this, but rather the main antagonist.

#### Task

After capturing Bond, the main antagonist and former MI6 agent is going through Bond's possessions, including his watch. It's not clear how intentional he is in disarming the mine with it, but he begins with comparing it to his own MI6 issued Seamaster.

  1. Bad guy Alec takes Bond's watch.
  2. He presses the top left button with his left index finger while holding the watch in his right hand.
  3. It looks like that disarms a mine.

#### Environment

  * Indoors
  * Well lit
