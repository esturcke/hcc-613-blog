## Design Context 

The goal was to create low fidelity prototypes walking through two of the
three tasks. I started with a task analysis for each:

### Reading a Message

- 0.  in order to read an incoming message
    1. lift wrist
    2. read message
        2.1 read text message on watch face
        2.2 turn dial to scroll
        2.3 open watch for inner display to see media content
    3. dismiss message
        3.1 press right button to archive
        3.2 press left button to trash

Plan 0: When notification vibration 1 — 2 — 3 in order.  
Plan 2: Do 2.1 and then 2.2 if needed for longer messages, 2.3 to read messages with rich media content  
Plan 3: Do either 3.1 or 3.2.  

### Explosives Detonation

- 0. in order to detonate explosives
    1. place explosives
        1.2 attach explosives to surface
    2. pair mine with watch
        2.1 bring watch near explosives
        2.2 confirm pairing of explosives
    3. detonate explosives
        3.1 select mode
        3.2 select explosives
        3.3 detonate

Plan 0: Do 1 — 2 — 3 in order.  
Plan 2: Do 2.1 — 2.2 in order.  
Plan 3: Do 3.1 — 3.2 — 3.3 in order.  

### The Prototypes

As we did in class, I mainly used sticky notes for the prototypes. I drew the
watch on a ziploc bag so that I could place it over the interface design
elements without having to redraw the watch.

## From [Version 1](/hcc-613/low-fi-v1.pdf) → [Version 2](/hcc-613/low-fi-v2.pdf)

I was able to conduct in class evaluation for both the "reading a message"
task and the "explosives denotnation" task. Some of the comments made while
attempting to perform the task given the prototype were:

  - "I would press the screen" (when trying to open a message)
  - "I would swipe it" (when trying to read more of a message)
  - "Maybe it's disconnected" (after pairing the explosives)
  - "What does the number mean?" (when getting ready to detonate)

There was an expectation that this would work like current phones and smart
watches with touch screen glass. The reason for not using is touch screen is
that I felt it would be too finicky in high pressure situation and that the
physical buttons would provide clearer affordances. I might be wrong with this
as we have been conditioned to touch glass to interact with devices. I have
kept the physical buttons, but will keep this in mind in future iterations.

The other thing this pointed to is that the icons were either unclear or that
cues of what the buttons did were missing all together. I initially dismissed
this that Bond is an expert user whereas this evaluation was someone using the
watch for the first time. But then James Bond is often presented with new
gadgets which he only uses briefly in each movie and so considering him an
expert user is probably not accurate. Either way, cues will help him even
if he is more familiar with the watch. This is the main aspect that I worked
on improving for the low-fidelity prototypes. This will need further refinement
when we move to higher fidelity.

## Reflection on Low Fidelity Prototyping

I really enjoy how hands on it is, especially compared to the web UIs I usually
end up creating. It's very satisfying to manipulate physical objects to create the
interface and make quick adjustments by moving UI elements around a table.
Although we started working with the actual display sizes, I don't feel as
constrained because much of the details are still omitted. Unlike when working
on a computer, low fidelity prototyping with physical items can be manipulated
by multiple people at the same time and so it is particularly suited for
collaborative design work. It is also very quick to make changes and to create
reusable components that can be used for multiple steps in a task sequence.

## Where I Would Use It

I actually have done this kind of low fidelity prototyping with sticky notes a
number of times at work when designing interfaces for new features for network
security products. After working on this I'm eager to approach early
design phases in this manner again. I love moving stickies around to try
different approaches. I had never taken pictures of the screens or used this
to present steps in an interaction, but I will be sure to apply this the next
time I get to work on designing a new interface.
