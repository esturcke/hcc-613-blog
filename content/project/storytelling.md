## Empathy Map

The [empathy map](http://thedesignsection.com/?p=4) was created to help refocus
on who Bond is and what his needs are. The intention was that this should feed
into how we told our stories. Somehow I missed this when working on version 1
and I saw the empathy map and storytelling parts of this project as two
distinct exercises. Any empathy featured in the first version of the stories is
purely coincidental. For version 2, I tried to tell the stories capturing Bond
as he moved between the "perfect" gentleman and someone who runs head first
into situation of extreme danger, with confidence, composure, but also the need
to execute perfectly. Like Bond, the watch needed to move seamlessly between the two.

## From Version 1 â†’ Version 2

For version 1, I took the [Pixar storytelling
prompt](http://thewritepractice.com/once-upon-a-time-pixar-prompt/) too
literally. It made it easy to pick out the components for the in class
exercise, but compared to my classmates, what I had was hardly a story.

I shared one of the "technology saves the day" stories and the main feedback
that I got is that it sounded more like a "showcasing the future stories".
Maybe this fits Bond as he does everything expertly, but there was a real lack
of tension where his watch played an important part in the turn. I found it
challenging to create that tension contrasting how dire the situation is
without the watch and how wonderful it is with the watch without creating two
disconnected stories. I followed the model of some of the stories shared in
class that I found compelling and try to set up more of a context. I continued
to keep in mind the Pixar prompts and tried to connect events with "but"s
and "therefore"s, but tried not to make the connections overly contrived.
Showcasing the future was easier to write, but also less interesting.

So without further ado, version 1...

> #### Bond's WATCH saves him from plunging to a fiery death 

> Once upon a time there was a spy named James Bond. Every day he was on missions
to stop evil in the world. One day he was bound and gagged and thrown into a
train car that was soon going to roll off a cliff. Because of that he had to
act quickly, but had limited mobility. Because his hands were bound together,
his left hand fingers could reach his watch. And because his watch was so
incredibly easy to use even without looking at it, he was able to activate the
laser and cut through the rope. AND THEN (just kidding), with his hands now
free, he was able to untie the rest of his body. Now fully free to move, he was
able to cut a hole in the train and escape as the train car was toppling over
the cliff.

> #### Bond's WATCH warns him when his is about to follow the wrong spy

> Once upon a time there was a spy named James Bond. Every day he had to chase
spies. Once day he was chasing a certain Russian spy and he watched her enter a
building. And so he followed her in and up the stairs at a safe distance.
Finally on the roof he watched her get into a helicopter and so he began to run
in an attempt to grab on to the helicopter so as to not lose her. But while
running, he got a message from HQ. Because it was easy to use his watch even
when running, he saw that he was actually chasing the wrong person. And so he
didn't jump to try and hold on to the helicopter, risking his life. Rather, he
watched the helicopter fly off into the sunset.

> #### Bond's WATCH let's him read past messages with ease

> Once upon a time there was a spy named James Bond. His life consisted of being
the perfect gentleman. One night over a Vodka Martini, he wanted to review the
messages of the day. His watch let him easily get to his inbox and scroll
through each of the messages. After finishing reading, the watch quickly
reverted to a classy timepiece.

> #### Bond's WATCH let's him detonate explosives from a safe distance

> Once upon a time there was a spy named James Bond. Each day was filled with
foiling evil plots. One day he was faced with a challenge of destroying an oil
platform that had been converted to a villain's secret lair. To do this he had
4 explosives, but they needed to be detonated at the same time, one on each leg
of the platform. To do this he attached one explosive to each leg and synced
them with his watch. To avoid being caught in the blast he sped off on a speed
boat and detonated the explosives using his watch. Confidently he rode off,
explosions behind him, and never looking back. 

...and version 2

> ### Technology Saves the Day

> #### Bond's WATCH saves him from plunging to a fiery death 

> Bond was sitting at the bar sipping his Martini. He was physically exhausted
having slept no more than 2 hours for the fourth day in a row. But you
couldn't tell. Always the perfect gentleman, he kept his composure and stared intently
off into the distance. A women sat down beside him and he turned to her and
offered to buy her a drink as his stark exterior softened. She smiled and
accepted. As Bond began to order the drink, she slipped a powder into his
drink. His tiredness had gotten to him and he failed to notice what had
happened before taking his next sip. He was soon overcome with a sense of
fatigue and light-headedness. His vision blurred and then everything became
black. 

> Hours later, Bond woke up to the rhythmic sound of a train. He was gagged and
his arms bound behind his back. He tried to pull loose but to no avail. But he
did manage to twist his arms just far enough so that his middle finger could
touch his watch. He managed to press the button on the watch to activate the
menu and then rotate the bezel to select the laser option. The laser engaged
and he proceeded to cut himself lose. With his hands now free, he pulled of the
gag and cut the rest of the ropes that had been binding him to the chair. He
then preceeded to cut a hole in the side of the train and leap to safety before
the train toppled off of a cliff.

> #### Bond's WATCH saves him from unnecessarily jumping in an attempt to grab on to a helicopter taking off

> Bond was sitting in a restaurant eating a late lunch when he saw a woman exit
through the emergency exit. He followed at a safe distance as she climbed the
stairs to the roof. There was a helicopter waiting. Bond was sure this was the
Russian spy who drugged him 2 nights before at the bar. He began to race toward
her as she climbed into the helicopter. Bond closed in as the helicopter began
to lift into the air and move away from the 12 story building.  His watch
buzzed and he peered down. It was a message from HQ. While running he tapped
the button and got a glimpse that his actual target had just been spotted
boarding a flight to Beijing. He stopped in his tracks right at the edge of the
rooftop and watched the helicopter fly off into the sunset.

> ### Showcasing the Future

> #### Bond's WATCH let's him read past messages with ease

> Bond returned to the bar to await further instructions. He sat down and ordered
a Vodka Martini. As he sipped his drink, he wanted to review the messages from
the day. His watch let him easily get to his inbox and scroll through each of
the messages. After finishing reading, the watch quickly reverted to a classy
timepiece.

> #### Bond's WATCH let's him detonate explosives from a safe distance

> Bond arrived at the oil platform that had been converted to a villain's secret
lair. He had 5 minutes to take down the platform and 4 explosives in his
pocket. Strategically placing one on each leg of the platform and detonating
them simultaneously should be enough to cause the entire platform to crumble.
He climbed from one leg to the next on the supporting structure under the
platform. As he placed each explosive, he synced it with his watch. To avoid
being caught in the blast he sped off on a speed boat and detonated the
explosives using his watch. Confidently he rode off, explosions behind him, and
never looking back.

## Using the Prototypes in the Stories

There are aspects of showcasing gadgets in Bond movies, although I didn't see them
playing major roles. They don't play central roles and the tension is built through
circumstance and finds resolutions in Bond's responses and abilities. Gadgets play
more into the neat factor and are often somewhat gimmicky. I hope to present the
prototypes with just enough tongue in cheek even though I will be bringing the watch
a bit more front and center to demonstrate how the UI has progressed during this project.

## Reflections of Empathy Maps and Structured Storytelling

Empathy maps are interesting ways to try and probe for hidden needs, challenges
and motivations of the user. It was challenging to come up with much that was new
compared to [earlier data gathering](hcc-613/project/data-gathering/), but this
perhaps brings out a clearer character of the Bond character: a smooth
gentleman, masterfully navigating constant peril. 

The ["therefore" and "but"
clip](http://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/television/100000001039812/a-clip-from-stand-in.html)
that we watched by South Park writers Trey Parker and Matt Stone was eye
opening. It give a very simple way to evaluate transitions in stories and help
form a story arc. A string of too many "therefore"s can be contrived and result
in a Rube Goldberg-esque story and I would argue that the occasional "and then"
can still work well. Too many "and then"s strung together, however, remove
any sense of causation or consequence. If the goal is to give the sense of
meaninglessness, this may still be appropriate, but in general "and then"
storytelling should be avoided. 

## Where I Would Use It

Storytelling is something that I have neglected in the past. It's difficult to
frame a prototype within a compelling narrative, especially when I'm in the middle
of developing and evaluating ideas. I often feel like I know too little about the
user to embellish in this manner and that I might misrepresent how the user would
use the idea I am developing. But placing the prototype in a context with a story
helps both with trying to see the prototype as the user and also to sell ideas
to others.
