# Evaluation Summary

Five more people were interviewed to gather feedback on the prototype video.
This time, two teenagers participated and three people in their 30s and 40s.
Again, all knew James Bond to some extent. Overall the participants
understood the prototype well. There was a comment that the hands of the
watch look like they are falling off when using special functions. A few
participants also felt that using the watch laser to cut through a train was
not realistic. Interestingly, this was an actual scenario taken from GoldenEye.
One participant didn't catch the interaction of how the explosives were
cancelled. They thought that Bond was just turning the bezel and didn't catch
that he pressed the second button. The responses to the story were favorable.
The participants found the level of detail good and that it was engaging. There
was some feedback of various parts of the story that could be tweaked. For
example, one participant found the cutting a hole in the train dragged on a
bit. Others thought that the story of why he was following the wrong woman
could be made clearer.

# What I Changed

I shortened Act I a bit in response to the feedback. The second laser cutting
scene was not needed and was cut. It its place I added some shots of the bomb
counting down to add suspense and explain way the train explodes. I also worked
on matching the watch text style better with the rest of the video. Some of the
feedback pointed to problems with the interaction to cancel the explosives and
I realized that I had forgotten to animate the bezel. I added that animation
and also held the shot on the cancel button a bit longer.
