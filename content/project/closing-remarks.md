I came into this class thinking it would be an easy semester, because I do a lot of UI design at my day job. It turned out to be a lot more work, but also more rewarding than I had expected. We spent considerable time working on story telling, something I had not really paid that much attention to. The Pixar storytelling prompts, the advice to avoid "and then"s, the encouragement to avoid a narrator were all new to me and very helpful in structuring a story to form context around prototypes. I would not say that I mastered this (or anything in this class), but this was definitely the most helpful part, pushed me the farthest and something I will continue to build upon in the long term as it really helps sell prototypes and convey the importance and utility of what I am making.

Something that is perhaps more immediately applicable are the brain storming and low fidelity techniques. These are both things that I have done before, but I saw again the usefulness and am encouraged to not skip over these early stages of prototyping. I'll start doing this again with the next UI I work on. With this I also got to see the benefits of the iteration and evaluation cycle. It was very help to be very intentional with the evaluation and approach each with purpose and the intent to answer certain questions. Before this I would often do evaluation with little thought. This is probably the area I still need to change in the most and is something I would like to work on in the long term.

Finally Keynote. What an amazing prototyping tool. I had heard about it being great for prototyping before, but had never experienced it first hand. It's so quick and easy to work with. Copying and pasting assets or duplicating slides works exactly as expected. The only limitation I ran into for my prototypes was with animation. I needed to move assets radially and couldn't figure out a way to do it. I typically use HTML to medium fidelity prototypes and so I'm not sure when I will try Keynote next, but I would say very likely within the next 5 years.

The End.
