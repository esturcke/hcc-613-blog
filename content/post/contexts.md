## Jacket from *Back to the Future Part II*


The context of this is use in daily activity as casual attire in the then future, 2015, in the film [*Back to the Future Part II*](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096874/). It was worn by protagonist Marty McFly as well as his son. Stylistically it looks somewhat like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterman_(sports)">letterman</a> with sleeves in a secondary color. As with the shoes that self-lace, the jacket can also automatically adjust to person wearing the jacket by adjusting the sleeve length. A feature that was highlighted in the film is that the jacket is also self-drying. My guess is that this could be useful if caught it he rain, or in McFly's case after foolishly trying to use a hoverboard over water and falling in. The jacket not only dries itself, but also the person wearing it.
