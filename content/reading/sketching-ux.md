## The Section

Storyboarding often refers to the task of sketching out a sequence of shots in
film production. It's used to visually tell the story. Here, the authors
present storyboarding applied to interaction design to describe sequences of
steps in the context of a narrative. This typically takes the form of a
sequence of screens connected by transitions explaining how the user advances.

Since storyboards are meant to tell a story, they should be more than a
sequence of steps. The authors take their cues from establishing shots in film
and discuss setting the context. This usually sets a starting point and gives
some motivation why the users will perform a certain task. The steps should
also be connected more than sequentially. The story should develop, reach a
climax and a conclusion. To this end, the storyboard will often extend well
beyond the screens and include important context to understand the user and
progress through an arc of a story.

## My Response

I have created story boards in the past for video projects and have even
captured some of these story telling elements intuitively, but it's really
helpful for these ideas to be made explicit. I see that although I have created
visual sequences of steps for UIs before, I didn't include the narrative
elements outlined here when it comes to computer screens.
