## The Section

Hoekman advocates cutting away features that are not necessary. To find
if something is unnecessary he proposes looking at features in light of the
following:

  1. Can you complete the task without the feature?
  2. Does the feature directly contribute to the task completion?
  3. Is the task itself vital?

Any "no" means the features is not necessary. If the answer is "yes" to all,
look harder.

He then goes through an example of what he calls "interface surgery" by stripping
unneeded features from an email client.

## My Response

This was fairly light and accessible reading. It was also very practical and
easy to apply. The 80—20 rule seems more like a rule of thumb, but does capture
the idea of diminishing return. In class we talked a bit about agile development
and how it doesn't leave as much room for prototyping and exploration, but a
strength is that it does constantly evaluate what is actually needed and what
will result in the biggest gain for the end user. I can see this interface
surgery approach working well in concert with agile development, but when
working on the scope of a single UI screen or a larger application as a whole.

My biggest gripe is when Hoekman took the 80—20 to imply that we only do 20%
of the work. While it could mean an overall reduction in work because fewer
feature need to be implemented, pairing down an interface can be significant
work compared to band aids. This also often means iterating even in
implementing features. The 80% market share statement is even farther fetched.
Still, the point of simplifying and cutting what is not essential is well
taken.
