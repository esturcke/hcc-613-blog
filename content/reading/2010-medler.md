## The Paper

Some design methodologies borrow from theater performance techniques. Medler
and Magerko look at two in particular, improvisational acting and role-playing,
and remark that design literature rarely make a clear distinction between the
two. They aim rectify this following work done as part of the Digital Improv
Project (for sample videos see [Party Quirks](https://vimeo.com/31301414) and
[3 Line Scene](https://vimeo.com/57422111)).

The authors explain that while there are many texts that deal with how to do
improve, little work has been done to understand what actually happens in terms
of group dynamics and cognition. Role-playing, in contrast, has been well
studied, including how it is used in the context of design. The result is that
when it comes to design, improv is used as a synonym for role-playing. Prior
studies found improv and role-playing did benefit ideation, as these
techniques helped participants become less self-centered, get better at
communicating, etc, but the requirements and parameters were scattered further
muddying a distinction between role-playing and improv. 

Medler and Magerko define improv as the "creation of an artifact and/or
performance with aesthetic goals in real-time that is not completely prescribed
in terms of functional and/or content constraints." That is improv unfolds
without the ability to go back and change things and while there might be a
guiding context, even that is not rigid and can be formed as part of the
performance.

Role-playing in contrast is acted out within a structured setting to which actions
conform with a goal of realism within the defined setting. It is rarely
audience focused like improv.

They authors present the following summarizing the differences:


|                                | Improv    | Role-play    |
| ---                            | ---       | ---          |
| **Constraint level**           | Low       | High         |
| **Group cohesion**             | High      | Low          |
| **Practicality**               | Novel     | Practical    |
| **Performace time**            | Real-time | Intermittent |
| **Leadership**                 | Dispersed | Hierarchical |
| **Training**                   | Required  | Not required |
| **Become less self-concious**  | Yes       | Yes          |
| **Better group communication** | Yes       | —            |
| **Creare new ideas**           | Yes       | —            |
| **Greater group focus**        | —         | Yes          |
| **Inform of user's needs**     | Yes       | Yes          |

From this they formulate some guiding questions to determine which of the two
is better suited for the design task at hand. For example, improv may be better
suited early on for tasks related to brain storming with viewer constraints,
while role-playing may be more suited later on when evaluating or more
converted with practicality.

## My Response

My initial response is that I'm too shy to want to do either of these. To some
extent I think many already do informal mental role-playing when working with
personas or evaluating designs and imagining what it will be like for a user,
albeit without the group dynamic.

When it comes to ideation, however, it might be interesting to witness the
benefits of improve as the performance unfolds. Still, the requirements to get
started with improve seem more prohibitive as well as the embarrassment.
