## The Section

When we think of sketching, we think pencil and paper. This section expands
that view to include sketches of physical objects, specifically using foam
core. These prototypes are similar to models created by architects, but rather
than being miniatures, the authors are concerned with 1:1 artifacts. The idea
is to get a clearer sense of the interaction with a life size representation. 

They also go into details of creating a cutout for screens and trays for UI
inserts/cards or storyboards that you can slide behind the cutout. The sliding
storyboards allow for sequential presentations, while the inserts allow for
branching prototypes.

## My Response

This is similar to the mobile prototypes in that we are trying to deal with 1:1
representations of devices, although there are trade offs. The size and shape can
potentially be more accurate, while the UIs displayed seem to in general be lower
fidelity. But this does seem to serve much the same purpose as the mobile
prototypes where you really get a sense of the size constraints.
