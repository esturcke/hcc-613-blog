## The Chapter

Task analysis deals with breaking down and analysis of how tasks are performed.
Even when dealing with human—computer interaction, it's important to note that
tasks often extend beyond the computer and are included in the scope of task
analysis. Similar tasks can be analysed with goal-oriented cognitive models
such as [*GOMS*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOMS) (*goals, objects, methods
and selection rules*), but rather than attempting to model the conginive
processes, task analysis focuses on external observations and modeling steps
and process. Task analysis is an iterative processes going between data
gathering (interviews, direct observation, from documentation) and
modeling/analysis. 

There are three general approaches:

  - **Task decomposition** — breaking down into a hierarchy of subtasks, a method
    called *heirarchical task analysis* (*HTA*).
  - **Knowledge-based** — understanding what needs to be known to perform the
    task by building taxonomies of objects and actions. One technique is *task
    analysis for knowledge description* (*TAKD*) by creating a *task
    description heirarchy* (*TDH*) with objects or actions organized under a
    hierarchy of actions and attributes. Objects and actions can also be
    described in terms of a *knowledge representation grammar* (*KRG*).
  - **Entity—relationship-based** — modeling objects—concrete objects, actors
    (people), composite objects (groups of objects)—by specifying attributes,
    actions and relations. This is similar to what is done when doing
    object-oriented programming. 

## My Response

Actually putting this into practice for the assignment week was helpful to get
at some of the difficulties in task decomposition. Examples are often straight
forward, but actually dealing with finding the right level of detail is a bit
more tricky. Even more difficult is figuring out how to best describe
dependencies on outside events and branching behavior. Creating taxonomies or
entity—relationships, on the other hard, even just sounds tedious.
