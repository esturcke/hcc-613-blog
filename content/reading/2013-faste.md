## What did paper discuss?

Collaborative ideation (process of idea generation)
Look how digital tools can help with ideation of distruted (time and space)
Look at brainstorming and then distributed brain storming or chainstorming
Then look at cheatstorming, where rather than trying to come up with novel ideas, exisint ideas are brought into 

They conclude that ideation is not primarily about new ideas, but redistribution of ideas

Brainstorming comes from *Applied Imagination*, by Osborn in 1953. COntext was creation process of advertizing

3 pahses to brainstorming:

  - fact-finding
  - idea-finding
  - solution finding

In particular, idea finding is neglectied and Osborn gave guiding princliples:

 - dont critisize
 - wild ideas welcome
 - quantity is better
 - build on other's ideas

But critisized if this is effective:
production blocking: people's ideas are trhottled because they have to wait for others, or ideas are neglected 
evaliation apprehension: there is risk and self censoring
free riding: peopel not as motivted to contribute



## How can this be used for project?
