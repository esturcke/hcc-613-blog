## The Paper

Classic brainstorming (brainstorming in groups) is a process for creative problem
solving with roots in 1940s and 50s advertising. It was formally presented by
Osborn in 1953 and since then has found widespread use while also facing
criticism in academic studies. Compared to nominal brainstorming (brainstorming
done alone), research has found problems do to:

  1. *Production blocking* – inefficiencies since only one person advances ideas at a time
  2. *Evaluation apprehension* – holding back because of what others may think
  3. *Free riding* – leaning on others to do the work

Faste et al. note however that proponents tend to be those actually engaged in
creative work, while detractors come at the problem from an academic
perspective not immersed of the nuances of the creative settings. Regardless,
the researches of this paper are more interested in how introducing
"strangeness" affects group ideation. 

To answer this, they looked at computer mediated ideation in the context of two
studies. In the first they present the concept of cheatstorming. Rather than
going through the process of generating ideas for a given topic, the group is
presented with 50 random ideas gathered from a pool of ideas from many other
brainstorming sessions. The thought is that new ideas are not a requirement for
ideation. This method eliminates the difficult task of generating new ideas.
Ideas are simply chosen that fit as a solution for the given topic. 

The second study also looked at cheatstorming, but in a more controlled
experiment. They compared 4 conditions:

  * **A** Baseline brainstorming
  * **B** Cheatstorming with overlapping diverse inputs
  * **C** Cheatstorming with unrelated diverse inputs
  * **D** Cheatstorming with unrelated narrow inputs

With both studies they found a certain amount of delight from participants,
especially as they discovered unexpected connections while skipping the
difficult step of generating ideas. In study 2, the plausibility of
implementing the selections were evaluated. Not supprisingly, the less related
the pool of ideas were, the more contrived and less useful the final selections
were. Still, the researches are hopeful that these are useful contributes to
the area of ideation. 

## My Response

I would love to go through this process with my project. It seems like the time
and effort investment would be minimal and even if the resulting ideas
are not implementable, they could very well lead to other ideas that could
actually be implemented.
