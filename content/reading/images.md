## The Section

This section give some practical ways to create images that can be used for
story boards. One technique discussed is creating templates. Often only parts
of the system change and so a template can be created for the parts that don't
change, for example by tracing.

This can be taken further by tracing and composing multiple images to create
new images. And finally, the authors discuss hybrid sketching where sketches are
overlaid on photographs. This gives both a sense of context as well as making clear
who the important actors and what the important artifacts are.

## My Response

The resulting sketches look very nice and put my version 1 storyboards to shame.
I will have to investigate implementing some of these techniques for version 2.
