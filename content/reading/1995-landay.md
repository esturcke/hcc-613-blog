## The Paper

Landay and Myers present an interactive design tool called *SILK* (Sketching
Interfaces Like Krazy). Design tools can be a hindrance, especially when
generating ideas and creating early UI prototypes. They often have ridged
requirements of what needs to be specified and details of designs might need to
be provided before the designer is ready to specify them. Because of their lack
of flexibility, designers usually prefer using paper or whiteboards. The draw
back of paper is that they are hard to organize and search, especially
annotations which are incredibly important in documenting the design process.
Also, it's hard to reuse items created on paper. Finally, infraction can only
be demonstrated with a person acting as the computer. SILK attempts to bridge
the gap between paper and electronic by providing the best of both. It lets
the designer use rough sketches and doesn't require them to over specify any
aspect of their design, but allows for items to searched, reused and can even
transform sketches into actual UIs.

## My Response

I like the idea of bridging the gap between paper prototypes and more ridgid
electronic tools. I really enjoyed working with paper and feel like something
would still be lost when not working with my hands, physically moving pieces of
paper around. Still, I would like to play around with a tool that allowed rough
sketches, but then could also infer the intent and begin to translate into UI
widgets. SILK looks a bit dated and perhaps not that compelling, but it would
be wonderful to expand on these ideas in modern prototyping tools.

One of the things we discussed in class is to treat prototypes as throw away.
This paper seemed to suggest that it is desirable to reuse prototypes even
until the actual finished product. I'm still undecided on this. I like the
freedom to know that prototypes will be discarded, and I have enjoyed the
benefit of reimplementing something after gaining deeper understanding while
working on the implementation of a system for a prototype. But on the other
hand, some things created for a prototype are ready to be reused in a final
implementation. Perhaps a good way to think of reuse is to not create
prototypes with the intent of reuse—don't make it a goal of a prototype—but
also be free to reuse when appropriate.
