[Keynotopia](http://keynotopia.com/) is a site that sells templates to be used
with Keynote and PowerPoint. Their goal is to turn these presentation software
packages into rapid prototyping tools for UI design. I found this particularly
applicable this week since we are doing just that. The demos are pretty
remarkable and show a lot of polish, much higher fidelity at least in outer
appearance than we are working with at this point. They are also not cheap with
a sticker price of $249 for the full bundle of resources, but this demonstrates
that presentation software is a viable tool even for late stage high fidelity
prototypes that are close to pixel-perfect. This seems like it would be very
useful especially for mobile device or native desktop software where there is a
recommended design language. For web applications or experimental UIs as we are
working on in this class, these templates might not prove as helpful.
