Again, I'm pushing off finding actual prototyping tools and finding prototypes
that inspire me. Again, these prototypes are clocks. Both using
[ferrofluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid)—fluids that are
attracted to magnets—to form the digital digits. Although the clocks are
digital, the fluids move in a memorizing organic manner.

## Ferrolic

This is the first ferrofluid clock that I had come across. This is by now a bit
more than a prototype as supposedly can be purchased. The
[videos](https://vimeo.com/116510462) show the soothing organic motion. I could see something like this being used for art piece data displays other than for telling time.

## Rhei

Rhei is closer to what we could a prototype, as it is more exploratory towards discovering feasibility. But perhaps this could also simply be classified as an art piece. Still, the page describes some of the process and obstacles that needed to be overcome as it was being developed.
