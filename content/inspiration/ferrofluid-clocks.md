Again, I'm pushing off finding actual prototyping tools and finding prototypes
that inspire me. Again, these prototypes are clocks. Both using
[ferrofluids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrofluid)—fluids that are
attracted to magnets—to form the digital digits. Although the clocks are
digital, the fluids move in a mesmerizing organic manner.

## Ferrolic

This is the first ferrofluid clock that I had come across. This is by now a bit
more than a prototype as supposedly can be purchased. The
[videos](https://vimeo.com/116510462) show the soothing organic motion. I could
see something like this being used for art piece data displays other than for
telling time.

## Rhei

Rhei is closer to what we call a prototype, as it is more exploratory towards
discovering feasibility. But perhaps this could also simply be classified as an
art piece. Still, the page describes some of the process and obstacles that
needed to be overcome as it was being developed. This
[video](https://vimeo.com/140469553) is also beautiful.
