German designer [Markus Kayser](http://www.markuskayser.com/) created [3D
printer](http://www.markuskayser.com/work/solarsinter/) that uses light from
the sun to melt desert sand to print 3D objects. I thought of this when we were
discussing novel 3D printing techniques that look promising but turn out the
have severe limitations. This on the other hand is clearly impractical. But
perhaps it is interesting to consider the printer itself a prototype rather
than just a tool to create prototypes. Kayser was evaluating novel materials
and energy sources in a desert environment.
