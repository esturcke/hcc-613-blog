## What it does

[Pingendo](http://pingendo.com/) is a free app to quickly prototype
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) pages. Bootstrap is a standard for
semantic HTML markup for flexible responsive layout that can be styled simply
and consistently with CSS. Pingendo allows components to be moved around the
page by dragging. The HTML and is updated automatically and can also be edited
by hand. It doesn't provide a mechanism to do any interaction design work and
as far as I can tell can only work with single pages. The main purpose seems to
be to speed up the creation of a Bootstrap page without manipulating HTML.
You can also use it [within the browser](http://v4.pingendo.com/playground.html).

## How I Would Use It

I'm not sure if I would use for the class project as this is specifically for
Bootstrap work. Additionally, since this is for static content rather than
interaction design, I'm not sure how much time would be saved vs dealing
directly with the HTML.
