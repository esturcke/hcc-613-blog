While working on the Video Sketch for next week, I came across two resources
that I found useful for audio: [Vimeo Music
Store](https://vimeo.com/musicstore/search/) and
[Freesound.org](https://www.freesound.org/). The Vimeo Music Store is a nice
place for royalty free sound. A handful of them are also free. I made use of
two of these for the Video Sketch. Freesound.org has tons of free creative
commons sounds effects of which I made ample use.
