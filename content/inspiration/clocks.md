## Digital Sundial

I've been interested in timekeeping since my project has to do with watches and
I came across this [awesome
sundial](http://www.mojoptix.com/2015/10/25/mojoptix-001-digital-sundial/) the
other day on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11094274).
Rather than casting a simple shadow pointing to the time on a dial, this
sundial has precise holes such that the shadows cast reads like a digital
clock. There is a [video on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrsje5It_UU) describing how it was
done.

## Automated Time Writing Clock

Then from awesome to totally insane I came across [a mechanical clock that
actually write the time for each
minute](http://www.ablogtowatch.com/suzuki-kango-plock-wooden-automaton-time-writing-clock/).
The
[video](https://twitter.com/BellTreeNursing/status/696232697824280577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)
is pretty mind blowing. Granted, this is much more than a prototype.  It's art
student Suzuki Kango's senior thesis. It's still inspirational creativity.
