Filmmaker [Stu Maschwitz](http://prolost.com/about/) has created a storyboarding plugin for After Effects called [Boardo](http://www.proloststore.com/products/boardo). The interesting thing is that the storyboard can be animated to visualize the camera panning, tilting, zooming and shaking. It also has some simple animation and cross fading tools. [This video](https://vimeo.com/77316243) shows an example of the kinds of dynamic storyboards that can be created with Boardo. Apparently, these storyboard take minutes to put together. I presume creating the artwork takes much longer and requires much more skill. The final result with sound is stunning. The price is $29.
