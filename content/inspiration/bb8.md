When we were talking about using Styrofoam for creating physical prototypes, I was reminded of [this instructable to creating a working BB-8](http://www.instructables.com/id/DIY-Life-Size-Phone-Controlled-BB8-Droid/). The body is smoothly sanded painted papier-mâché, but the head needed to be very light so that it could be moved with magnets and so was made out of Styrofoam. This is a replica and not really a prototype, but still inspires me. The detail is staggering.
