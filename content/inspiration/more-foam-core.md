I looked for some more prototyping with foam core inspiration and came across
[this Make
article](http://makezine.com/2015/08/27/heres-why-you-should-prototype-with-foamcore/).
This was focused more on industrial design rather than UI design we saw [in the
reading](/hcc-613/reading/foam-core/). I actually find this a bit more
compelling than the reading because the extra effort in creating the physical
artifact corresponds to what is being evaluated. The foam core from the reading
acted more as a frame for the UI.
